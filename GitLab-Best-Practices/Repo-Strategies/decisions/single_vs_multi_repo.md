# Decision Document: Single vs Multiple Repositories

## Requirements Statement
To support multiple environments (development, staging, production) for Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code, we need a strategy for managing the repositories that supports governance, reduces risks, and facilitates scalability.

## Available Options
1. **Single Repository**
   - Single repository with branches for each environment.
   - Centralized RBAC.
   - Easier to manage.
2. **Multiple Repositories**
   - Separate repositories for each environment.
   - Governance and RBAC can be applied more granularly.
   - Increased segregation of duties.
   - Larger codebase duplication.

## Recommendation
**Option 2: Multiple Repositories** - Separate repositories for each environment (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).

## Decision
We choose to create separate repositories for each environment to allow for better segregation of duties and reduce the risk of inadvertent changes affecting all environments.

## Justification
- **RBAC**: Easier to apply access control (e.g., restricting write permissions on `prod` repo).
- **Governance**: Separate governance policies can be applied for each repo.
- **Reduced Blast Radius**: Any misconfiguration is confined to the affected environment, reducing the risk across environments.

## Implication
- Slightly more complex repository management.
- Need for code synchronization mechanisms for shared components (e.g., modules).
