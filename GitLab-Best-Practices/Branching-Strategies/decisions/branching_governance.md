# Decision Document: Branching Governance and Blast Radius Reduction

## Requirements Statement
We need a branching strategy that ensures strict governance, segregation of duties, and minimizes the potential impact of errors in code changes.

## Available Options
1. **GitFlow**
   - Separate branches for development, feature, release, hotfix, and production.
2. **Trunk-based Development**
   - Few long-lived branches (e.g., master/main and feature branches).
3. **Environment Branches**
   - Each environment has a dedicated branch (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).

## Recommendation
**Option 1: GitFlow** - It offers a clear and well-structured branching model that is aligned with the need for governance and segregation of duties.

## Decision
We will adopt GitFlow for our branching strategy. This allows for clear separation between development, release, and production, ensuring safe promotion of code through environments.

## Justification
- **Governance**: GitFlow ensures governance across branches with clear control points.
- **Reduced Blast Radius**: Changes can be tested in dedicated branches before merging to `main`.
- **Segregation of Duty**: Development teams work in feature branches, while release and production are controlled separately.

## Implication
- A more structured branching model requires careful management.
- Longer development cycles due to review processes in the pipeline.
